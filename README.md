# HOW FORM INFLUENCES FINAL OUTCOME 
The idea for this project emerged after the conclusion of the Ekstraklasa (Polish top-tier football league) in the 2022/23 season. In those competitions, several teams had a similar pattern throughout the season, with one part of their performance being very good and the other quite poor. This situation affected teams such as Widzew Łódź, Piast Gliwice, Korona Kielce, Górnik Zabrze and Wisła Płock. In the case of the latter, a disastrous second part of the season resulted in relegation from the league Despite being the leader for the first 9 rounds.
